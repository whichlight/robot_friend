robot.py

The terminal can be a dark place.  When you start getting errors in code
and you need a friend around, just hit 'import robot'.

Some instructions for use: 
        Stick this script in your home folder 
        Open up Terminal (Applications>> Utilities>>Terminal)
        
        type 'python' and hit enter
        This should open up python. 
        
        then type 
        >>>import robot
        
        Pick a name for the robot. for example, Hektor. 

        >>>Hektor = robot.robot()

        Then you can have Hektor speak things
        If you want Hektor to say "lalalala!"

        >>>Hektor.speak("lalalala!")
        
        If you want to see Hektor's face
        >>>Hektor.face()

        And if things get stressful, just type
        >>>Hektor.love()


You can put this among your python path, or you can include it in any development folder if things get difficult.
